id3 tag parser written in objective-c. For use in Cocoa applications


Usage is straightforward: send the parser class object a parseTagWithData:error message, passing in data
that hopefully contains an ID3 tag. The tag has to be well formed, meaning it has to be the whole tag. I 
suggest also passing in an error object.

The return value is an array of dictionaries, one dictionary per frame. Each dictionary contains a 
frame ID, description of that frame ID, and the "value" associated with that frame.
Its up to the user to determine how the frames should be interpreted.
 
In this initial iteration the parser is limited to parsing id3v2.4 tags, and only the text frames (Txyz)

Support for id3v2.3, 2.2 should be coming shortly. As for tags, I'll probably add the URL tags (Wxyz)
and maybe a couple more, but that'll be it prolly.
