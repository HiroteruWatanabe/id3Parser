id3 tag parser written in objective-c. For use in Cocoa applications
Currently capable of parsing v2.4, v2.3 and v2.2 tags.


Usage is straightforward: send the parser class object a parseTagWithData:error message, passing in data
that contains an ID3 tag. The tag has to be well formed, meaning it has to be the whole tag. I 
suggest also passing in an error object.
